		<h2>𐐪𐑂 ♡Hiking Experiences♡ 𐐪𐑂</h2>
		<p>As I state in "my about", i always spend my time going to hiking with my family. so i would like to tell you about my experience on going hiking. I will tell you about hiking place that I already go that i think its kinda challenging for me and also have a nice view!</p>

				<h3>Taman Tugu</h3>
				<p>This was actually my first hiking that i go. Since it was my first, it is kinda challenging for me as i never been hiking before.Eventho this was an easy track, i've struggle a lot sice im not a very active person especially in sport.Tama Tugu is a forest park in the middle of the city that is well maintained trails and minimal elevation.There are 2 route which is the 3km long and the 5km long and I try both of the route.I almost blacked out but that's normal for me, After i pulled myself back together, I keep going until i found the exit.For me, its an experience to go hiking that almost 7km.</p>

				<h3>Bukit Batu Putih</h3>
				<p>Let me tell you about this hiking place! i think this place is very challengeing for me but worth it. This is because this mauntain is actually around Port Dickson beach. In every hiking place, there always have a different route and since i go this one with my family and my mom exercise group , we take a hard path that used rope to climb and etc.Like i said, the hardwork pay off. I get to see the most beautiful scenery which is the beach. There is another rope to climbe to take us to the highest rock ti get a better view but since im out of my breath and also scared, i'll just pass it. So, only my mom and my sister and others go climbed the rock.But still, i was a best experienece since i get to see beach after a long time during this pandemic .</p>

				<h3>Bukit Gasing</h3>
				<p>This was actually my last place i go hiking before PKP 3.0 and think this was an easiest track that i evev been. Maybe because i already used to it or i dont know but i do think that i do better while hiking in this place. There was a lot of stairs in this mauntain so kinda ripped my leg after i go back home. The route are kinda confusing for me but all of us still manage to finish it. Not to mention, theres a hanging bridge and i really enjoy going there!! It was my first time going to the hanging bridge and i was really excited back there. Also, funny story, my hiking shoes torn apart and i have to tie a rope around my feet to hold before i reach my exit. It was best and kinda funny experiences for me. i would not lie, my feet hurts so bad after a few days!! </p>
